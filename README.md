# My first website!

[Link to website](https://juliuscc.github.io/my-first-website/)

This is my first website ever! I suspect that I struggled with understanding anchor-tags and therefore gave up on ever finishing it. It was created somewhere between 6th of January and 6th of September 2013. I was really into mobile phones and decided to dissasemble an old SonyEricsson P800. I think that my plan was to do the same with multiple phones.

## Why green and purple?

I strongly suspect that I wanted to have circuit boards as background. ðŸ¤¦

## What has changed since the original

I've added a `README.md` file, a `.gitignore` file, and a `travis.yml` file. I've also removed a few files for legal reasons. Otherwise I have tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. I have even kept the broken html parts.
